# Planets-Image-Classifier

This planet classifier is able to distinguish between planets in our solar system.  The accuracy for this model was only 62%. The main reason was the limited data available for the model. The data was not clearly defined. Spending more time cleaning the data and getting more samples, would greatly improve the accuracy.
