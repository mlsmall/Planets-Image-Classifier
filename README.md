# Planets-Image-Classifier

This planet classifier is able to distinguish between planets in our solar system.  The accuracy for this model was only 62%. The main reason was the limited availabilty of data for the model. Getting more samples would greatly improve the accuracy of this classifier.

The architecture used was ResNet-34, which is a pre-trained network with data from ImageNet.  Below is the confusion matrix comparing the actual to the predicted values.
